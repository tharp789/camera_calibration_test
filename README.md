# camera_calibration

## Summary
In the code, there are two main files. The first file is `create_cal_board.py`, which creates the calibration board and outputs the corresponding tag IDs for the April tags. The second file is `calibrate_camera.py` which runs the camera calibration test on an image of the calibration pattern and checks the calibration error and the April tag detection. Pictures are also included of the tests run on this code base.
